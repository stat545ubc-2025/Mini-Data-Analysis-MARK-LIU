## About This Repository

The purpose of this repository is for a STAT545A student to complete his mini data analysis project so that he may gain more practice with the R software. As such, this repository include all of the materials required for a complete submission of that project. More details are given [here](https://ubc-stat.github.io/STAT545.github.io/webpages/mda/mda_deliverable1.html).

## Instructions

In this repository, one may choose to view either the *mini-project-1.rmd* or its knitted .md file. The .rmd file requires several packages before the relevant datasets are available for use. The packages in question are "datateachr", "ggplot2" and "tidyverse". The code chunks in the .rmd file ought to be executed sequentially to avoid the production of a variable-definition related error. The .md file may be browsed at one's leisure; in the case where one of the plot is too small, it may be reproduced and scaled within Rstudio from the .rmd file.
